# Extractive QA
In case of extractive QA, two datasets are used: 
* a very popular and large SQuAD dataset with questions and answers regarding broad spectrum of topics
* a SQuAD 2.0 dataset, that build up on SQuAD and adds samples without any answer

### Getting the datasets
In order to generate json files for extractive QA go through:
- [this notebook](../extractive-qa-old/notebooks/squad/other/extract_data.ipynb) for SQuAD dataset,
- 

Nothing else is required as datasets are read from the [Hugging face datasets](https://huggingface.co/) site.
