# Checklist

## To do

### Training

#### SQuAD 1.0
- [ ] Train BERT cased model on SQuAD 1.0 and evaluate it on SQuAD 1.0
- [ ] Train BERT uncased model on SQuAD 1.0 and evaluate it on SQuAD 1.0
- [ ] Train ALBERT cased model on SQuAD 1.0 and evaluate it on SQuAD 1.0

#### SQuAD 2.0
- [ ] Train BERT cased model on SQuAD 2.0 and evaluate in on SQuAD 2.0 and SQuAD 1.0
- [ ] Train BERT uncased model on SQuAD 2.0 and evaluate in on SQuAD 2.0 and SQuAD 1.0
- [ ] Train ALBERT cased model on SQuAD 2.0 and evaluate in on SQuAD 2.0 and SQuAD 1.0

#### Additional tasks
- [ ] Generate figures for training

### Others
